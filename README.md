# 'Shopping Cart' React Project.

## Description:

Mock E-commerce site built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. 

Users can search for, filter, and browse several categories of products, and place/remove products from a viewable cart, which can be accessed from any page. 

## Learning Objectives:

React/JS: React-router, context, React Testing Library, aynchronous data fetching (fakestoreapi), etc.

CSS/Design: modules, dark mode, responsive design, semantic html.

Context/browser router mocking was required to effectively test some components. 

## Limitations/To-do:

1. Aspects of the application are simplified. eg. User is limited to adding 9 of each product to cart.
2. To effectively scale application, more attention to efficient data fetching/handling would need to be paid.
3. Cart data doesn't persist when page refreshed.
